# module-1-challenge

In this challenge, I was tasked with taking existed code and making the necessary changes in order to help with the sites accesibility. Also, I changed the code to properly align with the css so the are both in a logical order. 

Here are the changes I made to the existing code to meet the requirements:

1. Changed the <title> tag to read Horiseon, which will help with search engine optimization as well as page accessibility. 

2. Added an id tag to the search-engine-optimization since it was missing and only had a class assigned. This enabled the page to function properly when you click on the search engine optimization tag in the nav bar, it now scrolls to the appropriate section. 

3. The navigation bar at the top of the page was listed as a <div> in the html code. I changed this to a <nav> tag to appropriately represent what it is. I also replaced a few more <div> tags with <section> and <aside> tags, where appropriate.

4. For all <img> tags, I added an alt attribute to properly describe the images and and improve the website's accessibility. 

5. Rearranged the CSS to properly match the HTML changes. Also, changed the order of a few elements to flow better and consolidated any parent-child duplicates. 

6. Deleted header div ul css property, was redudent since there is already a display on the next css declaration below it. 

7. Changed footer from h2 to h4 to keep the heading elements in sequential order.
